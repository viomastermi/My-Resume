            <ul>
                <li>The Beginning of Knowledge : Quran Memorization & Islamic Education In 2002 | Mu'izzuddin Ismail
                    embarked
                    on a
                    sacred path of knowledge by enrolling in an intensive Quran memorization program (Tahfiz).
                    Within
                    just two years, he successfully completed the memorization of all 30 Juz of the Holy Quran, from
                    Surah al-Fatihah to Surah an-Naas, a milestone completed with full dedication and spiritual
                    commitment by July 2004.</li>
                <li>Early Academic ExcellenceIn 2006 | he sat for the Selangor Religious Secondary Certificate (SMA)
                    examination, where he achieved outstanding results, ranking among the top-performing students in
                    Islamic education at the secondary level.</li>
                <li>Studies in Yemen: Islamic Medicine & Cupping Therapy | Between 2008 and 2011, Mu'izzuddin Ismail
                    pursued
                    further education in Yemen, where he deepened his knowledge of traditional Islamic healing,
                    including cupping therapy (bekam) and ruqyah syariah. During his time there, he gained extensive
                    hands-on experience in treating patients through both spiritual and physical healing methods.
                </li>
                <li>Spiritual Exploration & the Path of Tasawwuf | Between 2013 and 2015, Mu'izzuddin Ismail devoted
                    himself
                    to
                    the study of Tasawwuf (Islamic spirituality) and metaphysical theology through the Tariqat
                    al-Ghazaliyyah (Malaysia) and Tariqat An-Naqsyabandiyyah. His journey then continued to Egypt,
                    where
                    he studied under world-renowned Hadith scholars, Sheikh Muhammad Sa'id Mamduh and Sheikh Ahmad
                    Muhammad An-Nahrity, delving into Hadith sciences, Quranic studies, and Islamic healing. While
                    in
                    Egypt, he also embraced a third spiritual order, the Tariqat As-Syazuliyyah, deepening his
                    practice
                    of inner purification and spiritual discipline.</li>
                <li>Study of Metaphysical Healing & Islamic Energy Sciences | Throughout 2016–2017, he further
                    explored
                    a range of metaphysical healing arts, including Quranic ruqyah, spiritual energy work, aura
                    sciences, and Islamic-based internal force techniques (jurus) all based on authentic sources and
                    traditional wisdom.</li>
                <li>Transition to Technology & Software Engineering | Since 2019, Mu'izzuddin Ismail has immersed
                    himself in

                    and
                    gaining proficiency as a Full-Stack Developer. He has since ventured into web and mobile app
                    development, focusing on AI-driven platforms, automation systems, and digital product
                    ecosystems.
